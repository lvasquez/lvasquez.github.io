#### What I do

I write code, mostly web stuff and message comunications. I try to learn everything about everything, so usually I'm the guy that always question why? why this? why that? until I understand or have a kind of idea. I like to share ideas, knowledge and everything that can help to somebody, that's the propose of this blog.

So any question or feedback are always welcome, so feel free to contact me

Thanks for Reading
