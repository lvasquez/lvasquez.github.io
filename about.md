Hey there! my name is Luis, Virgo born, TDD guy, Geek, shower singer, videogames, beers, bikes and cats lover, MCSD - Web Applications and once upon a time guitar player.

#### What I do

I write code, mostly web stuff and message comunications. I try to learn everything about everything, try to understand the existence of the universe, the theories of special relativity and general relativity by Albert Einstein and those kind of weird stuff.

Any question or feedback are always welcome, so feel free to contact me

Thanks for Reading
