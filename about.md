Hey there! my name is Luis, I’m a software developer, MCP, MVC and BDD/TDD guy, Geek, drinker, bikes and cats lover and once upon a time guitar player and Gamer.

I love coding and test new languages, new technologies, new frameworks and new kind stuff that can be interesting. I always try to use the best practices and techniques with frameworks and libraries help, in this blog I will try to post some of my codes, any question or feedback are always welcome, so feel free to contact me, and yeah, my english sucks…  see ya

Thanks for Reading
