Hey there! my name is Luis, Virgo born, TDD guy, Geek, shower singer, videogames, beers, bikes and cats lover, MCSD - Web Applications and once upon a time guitar player.
<br>
<br>

#### What I do

Well, I write code since a C line I/O on a MSP430 to a HTML form, mostly web stuff and message comunications stuff like RabbitMQ and SocketIO. I try to learn everything about everything, try to understand the existence of the universe with the help of the theories of special relativity and general relativity by Albert Einstein.

Any question or feedback are always welcome, so feel free to contact me

Thanks for Reading
