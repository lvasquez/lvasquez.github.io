today I had a evaluation exam and one of the problems required to create a function in any language to implement the Check Digit Algorithm Mod 11, one of the interesting thing is that I never implemented this algorithm but thanks God they gave me the example and the steps, so basically the steps are these:

The procedure for calculating the check digit, which may be carried out automatically in a computer, is as follows:
<ol>
	<li>Take the first seven digits of the ISSN (the check digit is the eighth and last digit): 0317847</li>
	<li>Take the weighting factors associated with each digit : 8 7 6 5 4 3 2</li>
	<li>Multiply each digit in turn by its weighting factor: 0 21 6 35 32 12 14</li>
	<li>Add these numbers together: 0+21+6+35+32+12+14 = 120</li>
	<li>Divide this sum by the modulus 11: 120:11 =10 remainder 10</li>
	<li>Substract the remainder from 11: 11-10 = 1</li>
	<li>Add the remainder, which is the check digit, to the extreme right (low order) position of the base number of the ISSN: 0317-8471</li>
</ol>
If the remainder is 10, substitute an upper case X in the check digit position. If there is no remainder, put a zero in the check digit position.

and the code for c# is this:

{% highlight csharp %}
public class Mod11
    {
        public static string AddCheckDigit(string number)
        {
            int Sum = 0;
            for (int i = number.Length - 1, Multiplier = 2; i >= 0; i--)
            {
                Sum += (int)char.GetNumericValue(number[i]) * Multiplier;

                if (++Multiplier == 8) Multiplier = 2;
            }
            string Validator = (11 - (Sum % 11)).ToString();

            if (Validator == "11") Validator = "0";
            else if (Validator == "10") Validator = "X";

            return number + Validator;
        }
    }
{% endhighlight %}
as you can see is not a difficult code is a short code but requires a little of logic.
