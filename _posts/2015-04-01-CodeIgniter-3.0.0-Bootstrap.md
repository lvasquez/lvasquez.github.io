Since the last version announced a couple days ago of **[CodeIgniter 3.0](http://www.codeigniter.com/download){:target="_blank"}**, 
I decide to start one project with this awesome framework, and one of the first things that actually I do with any project when I start, 
is adapt the bootstrap. So this is a little empty CodeIgniter project using the CDNâ€™s of Bootstrap.
