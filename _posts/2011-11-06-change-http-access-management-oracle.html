<p>
well, if you want to change your localÂ  HTTP access management to local server and remote clients you just only need to execute this:
</p>
<p>
Fist you need to connect to the SQLPLUS with system user, like this(in my case):
since MS-DOS, type this:
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>sqlplus user/password@host as sysdba</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
user: system or sys
password: your password
host: your host
and once connected to the sql plus, type this:
</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>EXEC DBMS_XDB.SETLISTENERLOCALACCESS(FALSE);</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>
and that's it
